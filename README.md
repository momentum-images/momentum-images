## Image instructions

### Title, Home and Meta images

For each of the pages found here [sitemap](https://momentumimages.co.uk/sitemap.txt) create two images

`name-title.jpg` and `name-meta.jpg` replace `/` with `_` e.g. for `https://momentumimages.co.uk/portfolio/dance/` create `portfolio_dance-title.jpg` and `portfolio_dance-meta.jpg` and place these in the [public](https://github.com/momentum-images/momentum-images/tree/master/public) folder

### Portfolio images

Each portfolio has a folder in [portfolio](https://github.com/momentum-images/momentum-images/tree/master/public/portfolio) and they follow this convention `N_orientation_name.jpg`

*example* `1_portrait_Girl-dancing in-the-woods.jpg` Where the name will also be the description

You can have `portrait` which is `4x5` or `landscape` which is `16x9`

**Rule of thumg** You should have `1 landscape` and `2 portrait` or `2/4 portraits` of a photoshoot

**DO NOT** rename the images in order to get a neat indexing going on. If you delete an image just continue from the last number in the list. If you want to change the order, ask as it will be easier than working it out on your own.
